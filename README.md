# John Smith landing page

My another one page project. 
It is based on free graphic project i found on the internet.
Laout is built from scratch with flexbox and a little bit of css grid in some sections.
I used javascript only for hamburger menu.
It is full responsive.

## tools

* GULP  - running a tasks
* SASS - css preprocessor i used
* BEM - for class naming
